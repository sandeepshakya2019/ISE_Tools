### 💡 Problem It Solves

YouTube is a massive platform filled with valuable content, but:

- **No native timestamp bookmarking**: You can’t save specific moments within videos for later reference.
- **No organization or search**: It’s hard to keep track of important moments within multiple videos.
- **No easy export**: You can’t easily transfer your saved video moments across devices.

This extension solves these issues by letting you **bookmark specific timestamps** in YouTube videos, **organize and search** those bookmarks, and **export/import** them easily.
